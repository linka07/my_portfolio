linka07: how can i make a new file

GitHub Copilot: To make a new file in your workspace, you can specify the filename and the initial content you want. For example, tell me the name (like `notes.txt` or `main.py`) and what you want inside, and I’ll create it for you. Just let me know your preferences!

linka07: myportfolia

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

A new file named myportfolia has been created in your workspace. If you want to add any content to it or need another file, just let me know!

linka07: make a new file

GitHub Copilot: Please provide the name of the new file you want to create (for example, index.html, script.js, or notes.txt), and let me know if you want any initial content inside it.

linka07: index.hmtl

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

The file index.hmtl has been created in your workspace with basic HTML content for a portfolio homepage. If you need to add more details or want another file, let me know!

linka07: noo new file

GitHub Copilot: No new file will be created. If you need any other changes or want to work with your existing files, just let me know!

linka07: index.html

GitHub Copilot: You requested "index.html". Would you like me to create a new file named index.html (instead of index.hmtl), or do you want to update the existing index.hmtl file to index.html? Please confirm your preference so I can proceed.

linka07: yes

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

The file index.html has been created in your workspace with a basic portfolio homepage template. If you need to add more content or make changes, just let me know!

linka07: how can i add commentaries in vs

GitHub Copilot: To add commentaries (comments) in your HTML file in VS Code, use the HTML comment syntax:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

You can place comments anywhere in your HTML code to explain sections or leave notes. Comments will not be displayed on the webpage.

For example:
```html
<!-- navigation bar -->
<nav class="navbar">
    <!-- ...existing code... -->
</nav>
```

You can also use keyboard shortcuts:
- Select the text and press Ctrl + / (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + / (Mac) to quickly add or remove comments.

linka07: should i include footer too?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, including a footer in your portfolio is a good idea. It provides a place for copyright information, links to your repository, contact details, or any other important info you want visitors to see on every page. Your current index.html already has a footer section, so you’re following best practices!

linka07: how can i add colors to my website

GitHub Copilot: To add colors to your website, you should use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). You already have a stylesheet linked in your HTML (`css/style.css`). 

Here’s how you can add colors:
1. Open the `css/style.css` file.
2. Add CSS rules to set colors for different elements. For example:

```css
body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Light gray background */
}

.navbar {
    background-color: #333; /* Dark navigation bar */
    color: #fff;            /* White text */
}

.logo {
    color: #ff6600;         /* Orange logo text */
}

.home-hero h1 {
    color: #0077cc;         /* Blue heading */
}

footer {
    background-color: #222;
    color: #ccc;
}
```

You can use color names (like `red`), hex codes (like `#ff6600`), or RGB values (like `rgb(255, 102, 0)`). Save your changes and refresh your website to see the colors applied.

Would you like me to create or update your `css/style.css` file with some sample colors?

linka07: how to delete file in vs

GitHub Copilot: To delete a file in VS Code:

1. In the Explorer sidebar, right-click the file you want to delete (for example, index.html).
2. Select "Delete" from the context menu.
3. Confirm the deletion if prompted.

Alternatively, you can select the file and press the Delete key on your keyboard. This will move the file to your system’s trash or recycle bin.

linka07: can u add another file

GitHub Copilot: Please provide the name of the new file you want to add (for example, about.html, style.css, or script.js), and let me know if you want any initial content inside it.

linka07: about.html

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

The file about.html has been created in your workspace with a basic "About Me" section. If you want to add more details or create another file, just let me know!

linka07: what is <h2></2>

GitHub Copilot: The `<h2>` tag in HTML is used to define a second-level heading. It is typically used for section titles or subtitles within your webpage, making content more organized and readable. For example, in your about.html file, `<h2>Background</h2>` creates a heading for the "Background" section.

Note: The closing tag should be `</h2>`, not `</2>`. The correct usage is:
```html
<h2>Background</h2>
```

linka07: <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I graduated from ADA School, where I first became interested in programming and tech. Outside of classes, I’ve explored coding on my own — I completed the Udemy Python Bootcamp, which gave me a solid foundation in Python and basic software development practices.
I’ve also taken part in real projects and competitions. I was part of a team that won a hackathon by creating a fully functional website for an Italian restaurant. Another project I worked on was a logic-gate–based parking slot system, where I organized and simulated how cars could be guided using simple digital logic.
These experiences helped me understand both the creative and technical sides of building things, and they pushed me to keep learning and improving.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript,Python.</li>
            <li>Git & GitHub.</li>
            <li>Problem Solving.</li>
            <li>Physics.</li>
            <li>New language learning ablity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <p>I love exploring new skills and experiences, and I try to keep learning a little every day. Right now, I’m learning German, which has been both challenging and exciting. It’s fascinating to discover a new language, its structure, and the way it expresses ideas differently from my native language.Beyond academics, I’m passionate about dancing and traveling. Dancing allows me to express myself creatively and stay active, while traveling gives me the chance to experience new cultures, meet people, and gain fresh perspectives on the world.I also enjoy taking on activities that push me to learn something new. Whether it’s experimenting with a new coding language, trying a creative project, or solving challenging problems, I find it very rewarding to expand my skills. In particular, I love solving logic gate problems, because they combine critical thinking with creativity and give me a sense of accomplishment when I find a solution.Overall, I like staying curious and actively exploring areas that challenge me, from languages and logic to creative and technical pursuits. These experiences shape the way I think, problem-solve, and grow as a student and as a person.

Your new folder will appear in the workspace, and you can add files to it.

linka07: how can i add a photo

GitHub Copilot: To add a photo to your website:

1. Place your photo file (for example, profile.jpg) in a folder named assets in your project directory. If the folder doesn’t exist, create it.
2. In your HTML, use the following code to display the photo:
```html
<img src="assets/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Photo" class="profile-img" />
```
You already have this line in your about.html file.

Just make sure:
- The file is named profile.jpg (or update the src to match your filename).
- The file is inside the assets folder at the root of your project (so the path is project 3/assets/profile.jpg).

After adding the image, save your changes and refresh your website. Your photo should appear! If you need help creating the assets folder or placing the file, let me know.

linka07: can u add this assets foldeer

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

```html
<p>This is <em>italic</em> text.</p>
```
or
```html
<p>This is <i>italic</i> text.</p>
```

Both tags will display the text in italics on your website. Use <em> for emphasis (recommended for accessibility), and <i> for purely stylistic italics.

linka07: how can i add fonts

linka07: how to make those assets smaller in size

GitHub Copilot: To make your asset images (like profile photos or icons) appear smaller on your website, you can control their size using CSS. Here’s how you can do it:

**1. For your profile photo:**  
You already use the class `profile-img`. Adjust its size in your CSS:

```css
.profile-img {
  width: 120px;   /* or any size you prefer */
  height: 120px;  /* keep it square for a circle */
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

**2. For your social icons:**  
Add or update a CSS rule for the images inside `.social-icons`:

```css
.social-icons img {
  width: 28px;   /* or your preferred size */
  height: 28px;
  margin: 0 8px;
}
```

**3. For other images (like stickers):**  
If you want to resize sticker images, add a class or target them with CSS as well.

**Tip:**  
You can adjust the `width` and `height` values as needed. Save your CSS file and refresh your site to see the changes.

Let me know if you want the exact code added to your CSS file!

linka07: so in about page i have really nice design for navbars how can i add desif=gn to my home page

GitHub Copilot: To make your home page navbar match the design of your about page, you should:

1. Use the same HTML structure and class names for the navbar in both files (for example, use `<nav class="nav">` instead of `<nav class="navbar">` and `<ul>` instead of `<ul class="nav-links">`).
2. Make sure your CSS targets the correct classes (your design uses `.nav`, not `.navbar`).

**Here’s how you can update your home page navbar:**

````html
<!-- ...existing code... -->
<body>
   
    <nav class="nav">
        <div class="logo">MyPortfolio</div>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html" class="active">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
            <li><a href="extra.html">More</a></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="icons">
            <a href="https://github.com/linka07" target="_blank"><img src="assets/github.png" alt="GitHub"></a>
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/linka011" target="_blank"><img src="assets/codeacademy.jpg" alt="Codecademy"></a>
        </div>
        <button class="theme-toggle">🌙</button>
    </nav>
<!-- ...rest of your code... -->
````

**What this does:**
- Uses the same `.nav` class and structure as your about page.
- Ensures your CSS styles apply consistently.

After making this change, your home page navbar will have the same design as your about page. Refresh your site to see the update!

linka07: so i have this 🌙 sign,how can i make my website change to dark mode when i press it 

GitHub Copilot: To enable dark mode when you press the 🌙 button, you need a small JavaScript file and some CSS for dark mode. Here’s how you can do it:

---

**1. Add a dark mode CSS class (you already have some, but make sure it’s in your CSS):**

```css
.dark {
  --bg: #181824;
  --text: #f5f5f5;
  --accent: #ff90d0;
  --card-bg: #23233a;
}
```

---

**2. Create a JavaScript file to toggle dark mode:**

Create a new file named `js/theme.js` and add:

```javascript
document.querySelector('.theme-toggle').addEventListener('click', function() {
  document.body.classList.toggle('dark');
});
```

---

**3. Make sure your HTML includes the script:**

You already have this line in your `<head>`:
```html
<script defer src="js/theme.js"></script>
```

---

**Now, when you click the 🌙 button, your website will toggle between light and dark mode!**  
If you want the dark mode to persist after refreshing, let me know and I’ll show you how to use localStorage.

linka07: no it doesnt work

GitHub Copilot: Let’s troubleshoot and make sure dark mode works:

1. **Check your CSS:**  
You should have a `.dark` class that changes your color variables. For example:
```css
.dark {
  --bg: #181824;
  --text: #f5f5f5;
  --accent: #ff90d0;
  --card-bg: #23233a;
}
```

2. **Check your JavaScript:**  
Make sure you have a file at `js/theme.js` with this code:
```javascript
document.querySelector('.theme-toggle').addEventListener('click', function() {
  document.body.classList.toggle('dark');
});
```

3. **Check your HTML:**  
You already have `<script defer src="js/theme.js"></script>` in your `<head>`, which is correct.

4. **Check your CSS usage:**  
Make sure your CSS uses the variables for background and text colors, like:
```css
body {
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--text);
}
```

**If all of the above is correct, try these steps:**
- Save all files.
- Refresh your browser (try Shift+Reload).
- Open the browser console (right-click > Inspect > Console) and check for errors.

If it still doesn’t work, let me know what you see or copy any error messages here!

linka07: can u check my code

GitHub Copilot: Your CSS and dark mode setup look almost correct!  
Here are a few things to fix and check:

---

### 1. **Remove Duplicate `body` Selectors**
You have two `body` selectors. Keep only one, like this:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Atkinson Hyperlegible', sans-serif;
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--text);
  margin: 0;
  transition: background 0.3s, color 0.3s;
}
```

---

### 2. **Make Sure `.dark` Is Applied to `<body>`**
Your JavaScript should toggle the `.dark` class on the `<body>`.  
**Example JS:**
```javascript
document.querySelector('.theme-toggle').addEventListener('click', function() {
  document.body.classList.toggle('dark');
});
```

---

### 3. **How It Works**
- By default, `:root` sets the light color variables.
- When `.dark` is added to `<body>`, the variables inside `.dark` override the light ones for all children.

---

### 4. **Test**
- Save all files.
- Refresh your browser.
- Click the 🌙 button.

---

### 5. **If Still Not Working**
- Open your browser’s developer tools (right-click > Inspect > Console) and check for errors.
- Make sure your `js/theme.js` file is in the correct location and is being loaded.

---

**Summary:**  
Your CSS is correct for dark mode. Just ensure your JS toggles the `.dark` class on `<body>`, and remove duplicate CSS selectors.

Let me know if you still have issues or see any errors!

linka07: it doesnt work

GitHub Copilot: Your CSS is correct for dark mode, and your variables are set up properly.  
The most likely issue is with your JavaScript or the connection between your button and the script.

**Let’s make sure your JavaScript is correct and in the right place:**

1. **Create or check your file:**  
Make sure you have a file at `js/theme.js` with this code:

````javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const btn = document.querySelector('.theme-toggle');
  if (btn) {
    btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
      document.body.classList.toggle('dark');
    });
  }
});
````

2. **Check your HTML:**  
Make sure this line is in your `<head>` (it already is, but double-check):

```html
<script defer src="js/theme.js"></script>
```

3. **Test:**  
- Save all files.
- Refresh your browser.
- Click the 🌙 button.

**If it still doesn’t work:**
- Open your browser’s developer console (right-click > Inspect > Console) and look for errors.
- Make sure the file path is correct (`js/theme.js`).

Let me know if you see any errors or if it works after these steps!

linka07: doesnt work

GitHub Copilot: Thanks for sharing your code. Your HTML and CSS look correct, so the issue is likely with your JavaScript file or its location.

**Let’s make sure everything is set up properly:**

---

### 1. Create or update `js/theme.js` with this code:

````javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const btn = document.querySelector('.theme-toggle');
  if (btn) {
    btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
      document.body.classList.toggle('dark');
    });
  }
});
````

---

### 2. Make sure the file is saved at:  
`/Users/lina/Desktop/project 3/js/theme.js`

---

### 3. Double-check your HTML `<script>` tag:  
It should be in your `<head>` (which it is):

```html
<script defer src="js/theme.js"></script>
```

---

### 4. Test in your browser:
- Save all files.
- Refresh your browser.
- Click the 🌙 button.

---

### 5. If it still doesn’t work:
- Open your browser’s **Console** (right-click > Inspect > Console).
- Look for any errors (like "Failed to load resource" or "Uncaught ReferenceError").
- Let me know what errors you see, if any.

---

**Summary:**  
Your setup is almost correct. The most common issues are a missing or misnamed theme.js file, or a typo in the file path. The code above will work if everything is in the right place!

linka07: IN ABOut page i added 3 pics how to make them smaller

GitHub Copilot: To make the three images in your Achievements & Certifications section smaller, add a CSS rule targeting those images.  
You can use the `.achievement-card img` selector for this.

Add the following to your `style.css` file:

````css
.achievement-card img {
  width: 80px;    /* or any size you prefer */
  height: 80px;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 12px; /* optional: rounded corners */
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
````

You can adjust the `width` and `height` values to your liking.  
Save your CSS file and refresh the page to see the images smaller!

linka07: i want to change font for my whole web site how can i do so

GitHub Copilot: To change the font for your whole website, update the `font-family` property in your main `body` selector in your CSS file. For example, to use the "Atkinson Hyperlegible" font you already have:

````css
body {
  font-family: 'Atkinson Hyperlegible', Arial, sans-serif;
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--text);
  margin: 0;
  transition: background 0.3s, color 0.3s;
}
````

**Steps:**
1. Make sure your `@font-face` rules are correct and the font files exist.
2. Set your desired font in the `body` selector as shown above.
3. Save your CSS file and refresh your website.

Now, all text on your website will use the new font! If you want a different font (like a Google Font), let me know the name and I’ll show you how to add it.

linka07: how can add a new font

GitHub Copilot: To add a new font to your website, the easiest way is to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Here’s how:

---

### 1. **Choose a Font**
Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), pick a font you like, and click "Select this style".

---

### 2. **Copy the `<link>` Tag**
Google Fonts will give you a `<link>` tag. For example, for the "Roboto" font:

```html
<!-- Add this inside your <head> tag in your HTML file -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

---

### 3. **Use the Font in Your CSS**
In your style.css, set the font-family for the `body` (or any element):

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', Arial, sans-serif;
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--text);
  margin: 0;
  transition: background 0.3s, color 0.3s;
}
```

---

**Now your whole website will use the new font!**  
If you want a specific font, tell me the name and I’ll give you the exact code.

linka07: i added it in folder-it is meow_script

GitHub Copilot: Great! To use your new font (`meow_script`) across your whole website, follow these steps:

---

### 1. Add the `@font-face` Rule

Add this at the top of your style.css (adjust the path and file extension if needed):

````css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Meow Script';
  src: url('../fonts/meow_script.ttf') format('truetype'); /* Update path/extension if needed */
  font-display: swap;
}
````

---

### 2. Set as the Main Font

Update your `body` selector to use your new font:

````css
body {
  font-family: 'Meow Script', 'Atkinson Hyperlegible', Arial, sans-serif;
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--text);
  margin: 0;
  transition: background 0.3s, color 0.3s;
}
````

---

**Make sure:**
- The font file (`meow_script.ttf` or similar) is in the correct folder (for example, `project 3/fonts/`).
- The path in `src: url(...)` matches your folder structure.

---

Now your whole website will use the Meow Script font!  
If you want to apply it only to headings or specific elements, use the font-family on those selectors instead.

linka07: can u add it 

GitHub Copilot: Certainly! Here’s how to use your custom Meow Script font for your entire website:

**1. Make sure your font file is at:**  
`/Users/lina/Desktop/project 3/fonts/meow_script.ttf`

**2. Update your CSS to use the font:**  
Add or update the following in your `style.css`:

````css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Meow Script';
  src: url('../fonts/meow_script.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-display: swap;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Meow Script', Arial, sans-serif;
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--text);
  margin: 0;
  transition: background 0.3s, color 0.3s;
}
````

**3. Save your CSS file and refresh your website.**

Now your whole website will use the Meow Script font! If you want to apply it only to headings or specific elements, use the font-family on those selectors instead.

linka07: WHY DID MY FONT FOR HOME AND ABOUT PAGE CHANGE

GitHub Copilot: Your font changed because you have **two conflicting `body` selectors** in your style.css file:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Emilys Candy", sans-serif;
}
...
body {
  font-family: 'c', sans-serif;
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--text);
  margin: 0;
  transition: background 0.3s, color 0.3s;
}
```

The **second one** (`font-family: 'c', sans-serif;`) is overriding the first one, and `'c'` is not a valid font, so your site is falling back to the browser default.

---

### **How to Fix**

Replace both with a single, correct `body` selector at the top of your CSS:

````css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Meow Script';
  src: url('../fonts/meow_script.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-display: swap;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Meow Script', 'Emilys Candy', Arial, sans-serif;
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--text);
  margin: 0;
  transition: background 0.3s, color 0.3s;
}
````

- Make sure the path to your font file is correct.
- Remove any duplicate or incorrect `body` selectors.

**Result:**  
Your whole website will use your custom font (or "Emilys Candy" as a fallback) everywhere.  
Save your CSS and refresh your pages!

linka07: how to make my text go by lines down not ine 1 row

GitHub Copilot: To make your text display on multiple lines instead of one long row, you should:

1. Use paragraph tags `<p>` for each separate thought or sentence.
2. Use `<br>` for manual line breaks inside a paragraph (not recommended for long text).
3. Make sure your CSS does not have `white-space: nowrap;` on your text elements.

**Example:**  
If you want each sentence on a new line, use:

```html
<p>This is the first line.</p>
<p>This is the second line.</p>
<p>This is the third line.</p>
```

Or, for a manual line break inside a paragraph:

```html
<p>
  This is the first line.<br>
  This is the second line.<br>
  This is the third line.
</p>
```

**In your projects.html**, you already use `<p>` tags, so your text should wrap automatically.  
If it’s not, check your CSS for something like `white-space: nowrap;` and remove it.

If you want to break a long paragraph into shorter lines, split it into multiple `<p>` tags or add `<br>` where you want the break.

linka07: how can i make my cursor on web site have emojis

GitHub Copilot: To make your website cursor display an emoji, you can use CSS to hide the default cursor and JavaScript to move an emoji element with the mouse.

Here’s a simple way to do it:

---

**1. Add this CSS to hide the default cursor:**

````css
body {
  cursor: none;
}
.emoji-cursor {
  position: fixed;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 9999;
  font-size: 2rem; /* Adjust size as needed */
  transition: transform 0.05s linear;
}
````

---

**2. Add this JavaScript to your cursor.js file:**

````javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const emoji = document.createElement('div');
  emoji.className = 'emoji-cursor';
  emoji.textContent = '🐾'; // Change to any emoji you like!
  document.body.appendChild(emoji);

  document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    emoji.style.transform = `translate(${e.clientX}px, ${e.clientY}px)`;
  });
});
````

---

**3. Link your JS file in your HTML (before </body>):**

```html
<script src="css/cursor.js"></script>
```

---

Now, your cursor will be replaced by an emoji that follows the mouse!  
Change `'🐾'` to any emoji you want.

linka07: it doesnt show any cursor

GitHub Copilot: To make the emoji cursor visible, you need to:

1. **Hide the default cursor** and  
2. **Style the `.emoji-cursor` class** in your CSS.

Add this to your `style.css` file:

````css
body {
  cursor: none;
}

.emoji-cursor {
  position: fixed;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 9999;
  font-size: 2rem; /* Adjust size as you like */
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  transition: transform 0.05s linear;
}
````

This will hide the default cursor and make your emoji follow the mouse.  
If you still don’t see it, make sure your cursor.js is correctly linked in your HTML and that there are no console errors.

linka07: but i did it

GitHub Copilot: You did everything right!  
Your CSS hides the default cursor and styles the emoji cursor.  
Your JavaScript creates and moves the emoji.

**If the emoji still doesn’t show:**

1. **Add this to your `.emoji-cursor` CSS for better positioning:**

````css
.emoji-cursor {
  position: fixed;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 9999;
  font-size: 2rem;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  transition: transform 0.05s linear;
}
````

2. **Make sure your HTML includes the script:**

```html
<script src="css/cursor.js"></script>
```
Place this before `</body>` if not already.

3. **Check the browser console for errors** (right-click > Inspect > Console).

---

**If you follow these steps, the emoji should follow your cursor!**  
If it still doesn’t work, let me know if you see any errors in the console.

linka07: can u add it to my code

GitHub Copilot: Here’s the improved CSS for your emoji cursor.  
Add the `transform: translate(-50%, -50%);` property to center the emoji on your mouse position.

Replace your existing `.emoji-cursor` CSS with this:

````css
.emoji-cursor {
  position: fixed;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 9999;
  font-size: 2rem; /* Adjust size as needed */
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  transition: transform 0.05s linear;
}
````

This will make the emoji appear exactly at your cursor’s tip.  
Make sure your `body { cursor: none; }` is present (which it is).  
Now your emoji cursor should show and follow your mouse!

linka07: it doesnt show any cursor

GitHub Copilot: The issue is with your JavaScript:  
You are overwriting the entire `transform` property in JS, which cancels out the CSS centering (`translate(-50%, -50%)`).  
To fix this, combine both translations in your JS like this:

````javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const emoji = document.createElement('div');
  emoji.className = 'emoji-cursor';
  emoji.textContent = '💖'; // Change to any emoji you like!
  document.body.appendChild(emoji);

  document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    emoji.style.transform = `translate(${e.clientX}px, ${e.clientY}px) translate(-50%, -50%)`;
  });
});
````

This will keep the emoji centered on your cursor and make it visible.  
Save and refresh your site—your emoji cursor should now work!
